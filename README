In this tree there are two scripts: convert.py and generate.py.

The first was used to convert old semplice-desktop metapackage to a germinate seed.
Is not useful anymore, but if anyone needs it... is here.

The last is used by debian/rules to generate base-i386.
It should be ran in a SAFE chroot enviroinment - read carefully the comments in the script.

All scripts aren't in the standard distribution of metapackages, because they're
useless in user's point of view.

If you'are reading this from /usr/share/doc/system-*, you can get the source package from
Bazaar: lp:~semplice-team/semplice/meta-pulse
