Semplice Linux metapackages
===========================

This repository contains the packaging of the metapackages shipped with
Semplice.

Package building uses germinate to match arch-based lists with the right
packages.
"base-*" lists are generated through the generate.py script.

If you are reading this from /usr/share/doc/meta-*, you can get the
source package from Github: https://github.com/semplice/meta
